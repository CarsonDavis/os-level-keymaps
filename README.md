My primary keymaps concern discrete keyboards with inbuilt microcontrollers. However this repository holds keymaps that will run at an OS level.

The Mac keymap has the vanilla position for the apostrophe, which will eventually need to be updated to match the custom version I use, where the apostrophe and semicolon are switched.
